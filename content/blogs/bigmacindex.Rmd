In 1986 *The Economist* introduced **The Big Mac Index**, providing a unit of comparison for the cost of living in different countries and exchange rates based on the price of a Big Mac burger from McDonald's. Burgernomics was certainly innovative and in the analysis below I dig into [The Economist's data](https://github.com/TheEconomist/big-mac-data) for insights.

```{r, load_data, echo = TRUE}
#importing the raw data from The Economist
source_data <- read_csv("big-mac-source-data.csv")
historical_data <- read_csv("big-mac-historical-source-data.csv")
bmindex_data <- read_csv("big-mac-full-index.csv")
```
```{r, inspecting_data, echo = FALSE}

glimpse(bmindex_data)
skim(bmindex_data)

```

I firstly load and inspect the data from the `bmindex_data`, which is the data frame I will be drawing my analysis from. It displays information for 56 countries dating back to 2000. The most important variables that the data frame includes are:
<ol>
- `local_price`: local price for a Big Mac in the local currency
- `dollar_ex`: the exchange rate to dollars of the country's local currency
- `dollar_price`: the equivalent dollar price for a Big Mac
</ol>

# How does the price for a Big Mac vary across countries? 

```{r, slim_data_frame}
#reducing the data to July 2020 observations only
recent_data <- bmindex_data %>% 
  filter(date == c("2020-07-01")) 
```

```{r}
favstats(~ dollar_price, data = recent_data)
```

```{r cheapest_burger, fig.height=5, fig.weight = 10}
#plotting the variation in price for a Big Mac as of July 2020
  ggplot(recent_data, aes(x = dollar_price)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 3.58, color = "#DA291C") +
  geom_density() + 
  theme_few() +
  labs(
    title="A Big Mac costs $3.58 on average around the world",
    subtitle="Distribution of prices for a big Mac as of July 2020",
    x="Price(US$)",
    y="Density") 
```

As of July 2020 a Big Mac was priced, on average $3.58 around the world. Interestingly, the distribution for the price of a Big Mac is right skewed, suggesting that most countries have a relatively cheaper price, also reflected by the box plot below.

```{r cheapest_burger2, fig.height=5, fig.weight = 10}
#plotting the variation in price for a Big Mac as of July 2020
  ggplot(recent_data, aes(x = dollar_price)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_few() +
  labs(
    title="A Big Mac costs $3.58 on average around the world",
    subtitle="Distribution of prices for a big Mac as of July 2020",
    x="Price(US$)",
    y="Density") 
```

Next we look in more detail at which countries are towards the lower level of the spectrum and which instead are the most expensive. 

```{r, most_expensive_burger}

#reducing the data to the cheapest 8 locations in July 2020
cheapest_july20 <- bmindex_data %>% 
  filter(date == c("2020-07-01")) %>% 
  arrange(dollar_price) %>% 
  head(8)

#graphing the price in US Dollars for the cheapest Big Macs in July 2020
p1 <- cheapest_july20 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = dollar_price, reorder(name, dollar_price))) +
  geom_col(fill = "#DA291C") + 
  theme_few() +
  labs(
    title="South Africa has the cheapest Big Mac",
    subtitle="Price per country of a Big Mac in July 2020 ",
    x="Price(US$)",
    y="Country") +
 scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0))

#reducing the data to the most expensive 8 locations in July 2020
expensive_july20 <- bmindex_data %>% 
  filter(date == c("2020-07-01")) %>% 
  arrange(desc(dollar_price)) %>% 
  head(8)
  

#graphing the price for the most expensive Big Macs in July 2020
p2 <- expensive_july20 %>% 
  arrange(desc(dollar_price)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dollar_price, y = reorder(name,dollar_price))) +
  geom_col(fill = "#FFC72C") + 
  theme_few() +
  labs(
    title="Swizerland has the most expensive Big Mac",
    subtitle="Price per country of a Big Mac in July 2020 ",
    x="Price(US$)",
    y="Country") +
 scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0))


grid.arrange(p1,p2, nrow = 1)
```

According to The Economist's data, as of July 2020, South Africa was the country with the cheapest Big Mac (only $1.86) among the countries included in the study.
Vice versa, Swizerland, with almost 4 times the amount, sold the most expensive ($6.91). 

# Has Covid impacted the price for Big Mac? 


```{r graph_for_covid}
#reducing the data to July 2020 and January observations only
covid_data <- bmindex_data %>% 
  filter(date == "2020-07-01" | date == "2020-01-14") 
  
```

```{r}
test<- covid_data %>% 
  group_by(name) %>%
  mutate(
    January= dplyr::first(dollar_price) , 
    July = dplyr::last(dollar_price)
  ) %>%
  select(name,January,July) %>%
  mutate(percentage_change = round(((July - January)/January)*100,2)) %>% 
  slice(1:10) 
 
test <- test[!duplicated(test$name),]

test

```

```{r}
ggplot(test, aes(y = percentage_change, x = name, fill = name, label = name)) +
  geom_col() + 
  labs(title = "Percentage change in ", x = "Country", y = "Percentage change") + 
  geom_text(size = 3, check_overlap = TRUE) +
  theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank()) 

```
