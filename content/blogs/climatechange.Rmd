# Analysis of Temperature Anomalies 
The Covid-19 emergency has put a halt on, and arguably reversed, the fight for sustainability. However, the below analysis of historical temperature anomalies serves as a reminder that efforts against climate change cannot be postponed. 

##Familiarizing with the data
The raw data, which I *import* below, is sourced from [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp), who recorded the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere. The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here.](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}
#importing the data from NASA's GISS
weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")
```

Firstly I *inspect* the data frame weather, which consists of 140 rows, corresponding to observations, and 19 columns, the variables describing each observation. To adjust the data frame for my analysis, I select the relevant columns (`Year` and the 12 months variables) and use the function `pivot_longer`to reorder the data points, creating the new data frame below, named `tidyweather`. This displays the monthly deviations from the expected temperature (`delta`) recorded since 1880. 

```{r }
#inspecting the data 
glimpse(weather)
# checking for missing values and duplicates
skim(weather)

#remove unnecessary columns from the original data frame
remove_cols <- weather %>%
  select(1:13)
#adjust the data frame
tidyweather <- remove_cols %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:13, names_to = "Month", values_to = "delta")
```

```{r tidyweather}
#viewing the new data frame
glimpse(tidyweather)
```

## Visualizing the data
To visualize the temperature deviations I build the following time-series scatter plot and add a trend line, which evidences the constant increase in anomalies throughout the centuries.

```{r scatter_plot, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 10}

#adding a variable ('date') to plot in a chronological order 
tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

#creating the scatter plot
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
#adjusting the color and size for the points
  geom_point(size = 0.5, color = "grey")+
#inserting a trend line
  geom_smooth(color="white") +
#labelling the graph
  labs (
    title = "GLOBAL WARMING", subtitle = "Temperature anomalies since 1880", x = "Year", y = "Temperature Deviation", caption = "Source: NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies"
  ) + 
#adjusting color and size for the background, axis and text 
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#2B304A", color = "#2B304A"), 
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(color = "#C7C8CF", size = 10),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(color = "#C7C8CF", size = 9),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#2B304A"),
        axis.title = element_text(color = "#C7C8CF"), 
        axis.text = element_text(color = "#C7C8CF"),
        axis.line = element_line(color = "#C7C8CF"),
        plot.caption = element_text(color = "#2B304A"))

```

Interested to analyse more closely the anomalies for the past three decades, I group the data into the different time intervals (1990-2000, 2000-2010, 2010-2020 respectively) and create a density plot to visualize the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`) in these three time periods. 

```{r intervals}
#The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data 
#in three time periods: 1990-2000, 2000-2010, 2010-2020. 

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1990) %>%     #remove years prior to 1990
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1990:2000) ~ "1990-2000",
    Year %in% c(2000:2010) ~ "2000-2010",
    Year %in% c(2010:2020) ~ "2010-2020"))
  
  comparison 
  
  comparison <- comparison %>%
  rename("Delta" = "delta" , 'Full Date' = 'date',
         'Months' = 'month','Years' = 'year' ,
         'Interval' = 'interval')

```

```{r density_plot, fig.height = 5, fig.width=10}

comparison%>%
group_by(Interval)%>%
ggplot(aes(x=Delta, fill=Interval)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   
  labs (title = "Both temperature and unpredictability of the weather are increasing", subtitle = "Distribution of temperature deviations per decade since 1990", x = "Temperature Deviations", caption ="Source: NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies") + theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#2B304A", color = "#2B304A"), 
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(color = "#C7C8CF", size = 10),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(color = "#C7C8CF", size = 9),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#2B304A"),
        axis.title = element_text(color = "#C7C8CF"), 
        axis.text = element_text(color = "#C7C8CF"),
        axis.line = element_line(color = "#C7C8CF"),
        plot.caption = element_text(color = "#C7C8CF"),
        legend.key = element_rect(fill = "#2B304A"),
        legend.text = element_text(color = "#C7C8CF"),
        legend.title = element_text(color = "#C7C8CF"),
         legend.background = element_rect(fill = "#2B304A"))


```

```{r density_plot}

summary_stat <- favstats( Delta ~ Interval, data = comparison)

summary_stat %>%
  kbl(caption = 'Statistics on Temperature Anomalies')%>%
  kable_styling()

```

From the above summary statistics we can note that the mean, median, minimum and maximum `delta` are each decade higher than the previous. Indeed, evident from both the density plot and the summary statistics, we can observe that the temperatures are rising and becoming unpredictable.

##  Annual Temperature Anomalies since 2010

Looking at the last decade, the average annual `delta` since 2010 has been of 0.96, as calculated below. To have a more comprehensive understanding of the average `delta` I also proceed with calculating the confidence interval. 

```{r, annual delta since 2010}
avg_annual_delta <- comparison %>% 
  # choose deltas after 2010
  filter(Year>= 2010) %>% 
  #calculate summary statistics for annual delta
  summarise(mean=mean(Delta,na.rm=TRUE),sd=sd(Delta,na.rm=TRUE), count=n(),se=sd/sqrt(count)) 

avg_annual_delta
```

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}

#calculating the confidence interval
formula_ci <- avg_annual_delta %>% 
  summarise(lower_ci = mean-1.96*se, upper_ci = mean+1.96*se) %>%
  rename("Lower Boundary" = 'lower_ci', "Upper Boundary" = 'upper_ci' ) %>%
kbl(caption = 'Confidence Interval for the annual delta since 2010')%>%
  kable_styling() 

formula_ci 
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}
#calculating confidence interval with bootstrapping
bootstrap_delta <- comparison %>% 
  filter(Year>= 2010) %>% 
  specify(response=Delta) %>%
  generate(reps =1000, type ="bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat ="mean")
infer_ci <- bootstrap_delta %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level=0.95,type="percentile") %>%
  rename("Lower Boundary" = 'lower_ci', "Upper Boundary" = 'upper_ci' ) 

infer_ci %>%
  kbl(caption = 'Confidence Interval for the annual delta since 2011')%>%
  kable_styling()
```

Above, I fist manually calculate the confidence interval using the Standard Error, Count and Mean values derived from the summary statistics. Since I am assuming a normal distribution, I use the critical Z value for 95%, which is 1.96. 
For the second method, I have bootstrapped the data by sampling 1000 times and calculated the mean from all these sampled sets. The two methods yielded almost the same result: the 95% confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2010, is 0.91-1 degrees celsius, visualized in the plot below.

```{r, fig.height = 5, fig.width=10}

visualize(bootstrap_delta) + 
  shade_ci(endpoints = infer_ci, fill = "white", colour = "white")+ 
  #The confidence interval
  geom_vline(xintercept = infer_ci$lower_ci, colour = "white")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = infer_ci$upper_ci, colour = "white") +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#2B304A", color = "#2B304A"), 
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(color = "#C7C8CF", size = 10),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(color = "#C7C8CF", size = 9),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#2B304A"),
        axis.title = element_text(color = "#C7C8CF"), 
        axis.text = element_text(color = "#C7C8CF"),
        axis.line = element_line(color = "#C7C8CF"),
        plot.caption = element_text(color = "#C7C8CF"),
        legend.key = element_rect(fill = "#2B304A"),
        legend.text = element_text(color = "#C7C8CF"),
        legend.title = element_text(color = "#C7C8CF"),
         legend.background = element_rect(fill = "#2B304A"))
  
  
```

## Global warming a reality we must face

From this analysis of historical data it becomes evident that temperature deviations have been rising and that every decade we are experiencing a greater number and variation of annual anomalies.
Our confidence interval suggests, at best, temperature anomalies of 0.91°C, which is extremely problematic given that [NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.
